# This isn't really a script but it does show you how to get
# the mx5000 keyb and mx1000 mouse up and running on 12.04

# First do the keyboard

# 1 - press the red button on the back so it's in connecting mode
#     if you want to check whether or not the system can see it:     

	hcitool scan

# That should show you the MACs of any connected devices

# 2 - Pair the keyboard with these:

	sudo bluez-simple-agent hci0 00:07:61:39:95:42

# That ask you to enter a pin, enter something. Shortly after you'll be asked to enter it on the keyboard

	sudo bluez-test-device-trusted 00:07:61:39:95:42 yes
	sudo bluez-test-input connect 00:07:61:39:95:42

# Now you should have keyb

# Now it's mouse time

	sudo bluez-simple-agent hci0 00:07:61:39:B6:53

# Enter 0000 for the PIN

	sudo bluez-test-device trusted 00:07:61:39:B6:53 yes
	sudo bluez-test-input connect 00:07:61:39:B6:53
